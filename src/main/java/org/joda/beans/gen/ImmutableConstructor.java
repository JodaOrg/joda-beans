/**
 * Annotation defining which constructor is to be used to create the object
 * in for code generation of immutable beans.
 * <p>
 * The constructor must have the same arguments and types as the properties
 * as exposed by the builder. They must also be in the same order.
 * The constructor is responsible for maintaining the invariants of the class,
 * such as validation.
 * <p>
 * For example, a property type of 'ImmutableList&lt;Foo&gt;' will have a builder
 * type of 'List&lt;Foo&gt;', thus the constructor must also use 'List'.
 * <p>
 * If no constructor specifies this annotation then a constructor will be generated.
 * In many cases it is easiest to generate the constructor, then move it outside
 * the autogenerated block and annotate it.
