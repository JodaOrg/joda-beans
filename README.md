Joda-Beans
------------

Joda-Beans provides a small framework that adds properties to Java, greatly enhancing JavaBeans.
An API is provided that defines a bean and property model, together with a code generator to make it work in practice.

The key concept is to allow each property on a bean to be accessed as an object.
This enables technologies such as XPath, XML conversion, DB mappings, WebApp validation and Swing bindings.

### Why Joda Beans?

Joda-Beans has been created to plug a gap in the Java language - properties.
The concept of properties is familiar to those coding in almost every other modern language.
Java stands alone in its pursuit of the terrible JavaBean approach, and personally I believe that
properties should have been added to Java before generics and closures.

JavaBeans are typically created by manual coding or one-off IDE generation, such as by Eclipse.
The same approach is taken to the creation of equals and hashCode methods.
However, none of these approaches provides for a simple and fast mechanism to query a bean for the properties it exposes.

Joda-Beans provides a solution. As a developer, you just write the fields much as you would today.
Then you add annotations to the bean and properties.
Finally, you run a code generator, which creates the get/set methods plus framework methods that allow the properties
to be effectively queried.
If you use Eclipse and the Joda-Beans Maven plugin, the bean will be regenerated automatically on save.

A key point is that the code generator may be run again and again on the Java file, and is non-destructive.

### Releases
[Release 2.7.1](https://www.joda.org/joda-beans/download.html) is the current release.
This release is considered stable and worthy of the 2.x tag.
There are only [minor incompatibilities](https://www.joda.org/joda-beans/migration.html) with the 1.x codebase.

Joda-Beans requires Java SE 8 or later and depends on [Joda-Convert](https://www.joda.org/joda-convert/).
There are a number of [optional dependencies](https://www.joda.org/joda-beans/dependencies.html) which help with integration.

Available in the [Maven Central repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.joda%20AND%20a:joda-beans&core=gav)

For Java SE 6 compatibility, use [release 1.14](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-beans/releases/tag/v1.14).
