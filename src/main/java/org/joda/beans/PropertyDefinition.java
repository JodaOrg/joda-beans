     * The style of the method used to query the property.

     * The style of the method used to mutate the property.
     * <p>
     * The style is a string describing the mutator, typically used for code generation.
     * By default this is 'smart' which will use the source code knowledge to determine
     * what to generate. This will be a method of the form {@code setXxx()} for all types unless
     * the field is {@code final}. If the field is a final {@code Collection} or {@code Map}
     * of a known type then a set method is generated using {@code addAll} or {@code puAll}
     * <p>
     * Standard style stings are:
     * <ul>
     * <li>'' - do not generate any form of setter
     * <li>'smart' - process intelligently - uses 'set' unless final, when it will use 'setClearAddAll'
     *  for common list types or 'setClearPutAll' for common map types and FlexiBean
     * <li>'set' - generates setXxx()
     * <li>'setClearAddAll' - generates setXxx() using field.clear() and field.addAll(newData)
     * <li>'setClearPutAll' - generates setXxx() using field.clear() and field.putAll(newData)
     * <li>'manual' - a method named setXxx() must be manually provided at package scope or greater
     * <li>a pattern, see below
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * A pattern can be used for special behaviour.
     * The pattern is a complete piece of code.
     * For example, 'new Foo($value)' or '$field = $value.clone()'.<br/>
     * '$field' for the field to copy into.<br/>
     * '$value' for the value to copy from.<br/>
     * '&gt;&lt;' for the generics of the type including angle brackets.<br/>
     * '\n' for a new line (all lines must then include semi-colons).<br/>

     * <p>
     * This is used when the type of the field is not the same as the type
     * as should be used in public methods such as getters and setters.

     * By default no validation is performed.
     * The code generator places the validation into the set method and ensures that
     * new objects are validated correctly.
     * <p>
     * Custom validations, are written by writing a static method and referring to it.
     * For example, {@code public void checkMyValue(Integer val, String propertyName) ...}
     * The method generally has a {@code void} return, throwing an exception if validation fails.
     * There must be two arguments, the value and the property name. The value may be the
     * property type or a superclass (like Object). The property name should be a String.
     * <p>
     * Standard validation stings are:
     * <ul>
     * <li>'' - do not generate any form of validation
     * <li>'notNull' - suitable for checking that the value is non-null,
     *  calls JodaBeanUtils.notNull() which throws an IllegalArgumentException
     * <li>'notEmpty' - suitable for checking that a string is non-null and non-empty,
     *  calls JodaBeanUtils.notEmpty() which throws an IllegalArgumentException
     * <li>'{className}.{staticMethodName}' - a custom validation method, described above
