/**
 * Provides the ability for a Joda-Bean to be written to a binary format.
 * <p>
 * This class contains mutable state and cannot be used from multiple threads.
 * A new instance must be created for each message.
 * <p>
 * The binary format is based on MessagePack v2.0.
 * Each bean is output as a map using the property name.
 * <p>
 * Most simple types, defined by Joda-Convert, are output as MessagePack strings.
 * However, MessagePack nil, boolean, float, integral and bin types are also used
 * for null, byte[] and the Java numeric primitive types (excluding char).
 * <p>
 * Beans are output using MessagePack maps where the key is the property name.
 * Collections are output using MessagePack maps or arrays.
 * Multisets are output as a map of value to count.
 * <p>
 * If a collection contains a collection then addition meta-type information is
 * written to aid with deserialization.
 * At this level, the data read back may not be identical to that written.
 * <p>
 * Where necessary, the Java type is sent using an 'ext' entity.
 * Three 'ext' types are used, one each for beans, meta-type and simple.
 * The class name is passed as the 'ext' data.
 * The 'ext' value is sent as an additional key-value pair for beans, with the
 * 'ext' as the key and 'nil' as the value. Where the additional type information
 * is not about a bean, a tuple is written using a size 1 map where the key is the
 * 'ext' data and the value is the data being annotated.
 * <p>
 * Type names are shortened by the package of the root type if possible.
 * Certain basic types are also handled, such as String, Integer, File and URI.
