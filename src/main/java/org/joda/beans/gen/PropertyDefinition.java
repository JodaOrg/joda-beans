     * <li>'protected' - process as per 'smart' but set scope as protected
     * <li>'set' - generates setXxx()
     * <li>'setClearAddAll' - generates setXxx() using field.clear() and field.addAll(newData)
     * <li>'setClearPutAll' - generates setXxx() using field.clear() and field.putAll(newData)
